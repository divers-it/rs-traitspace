### trait_recoding.csv 
A table showing how states and traits were recoded from the original PROTEUS classification to the classification used in this study.

### clustering_results.csv
Groupings of species into clusters and robust groups using different clustering methods and encodings. `ward' = hierarchical clustering with the `wardD2' method, `kpro' = robust groups derived from K-prototype clustering, `pam' = robust groups derived from partitioning around medoids clustering, `dens' = clustering from the density clustering approach. Columns starting with `one\_hot' are results from the one-hot, rather than the original, data set.
