## Workflow

### 1_proteus_data_preparation_discrete.R

Read in PROTEUS data and recode discrete data based on trait_recoding table

### 2_proteus_data_preparation_quant.R

Read in PROTEUS data and prepare quantiative data

### 3_recode_quantitative_discrete.R

Convert some quantitative variables to discrete ones

### 4_merge_subset_data.R

Combine discrete, quantitative and discretized data into one data frame

### 5_clean_filter_df.R
