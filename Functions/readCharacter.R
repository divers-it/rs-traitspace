#Function by Herv√© Sauquet (2016)
#Reads character data, character name, and character state names for a given character (charindex) from a matrix of data (charmatrix) and character and character state names (charnames)
#The list of tips in correct order (tips) is required to prepare the list of polymorphic tips (for mapping purposes)
#The color vector (co) is required to be subset in the event that absent states are detected
#Returns a whole bunch of objects used in the ASR script:
#	charData is a vector of data (in numeric format, missing as NA) tagged with taxon names; it is used in the ASR and fabtree functions for tip branch and terminal node coloring (for mapping purposes) only, not as source data
#	charname is a single-element vector containing the fully spelled character name
#	states is a vector of character state names
#	nrstates is a single-element vector containing the number of character states present in the dataset (i.e., original number of character states minus number of absent states)
#	dropdiag is a vector of diagonal references used to extract estimated transition rates from the transition rate matrix output by the rayDISC function
#	ratecolnames is a vector of transition rate names used to produce meaningful column names in summary table outputs
#	poltips is a matrix of polymorphic tips (1st column: tip number; next columns: state pseudoprobabilities)
#	subco is a vector of colors subset from the original color vector provided
#Note that none of this code is required to perform the actual ASR optimization or even to map simple node pie charts with ancestral states onto a plotted tree
