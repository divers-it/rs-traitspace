### trait_recoding.csv 
A table showing how states and traits were recoded from the original PROTEUS classification to the classification used in this study.

### clustering_results.csv
Groupings of species into clusters and robust groups using different clustering methods and encodings. `ward' = hierarchical clustering with the `wardD2' method, `kpro' = robust groups derived from K-prototype clustering, `pam' = robust groups derived from partitioning around medoids clustering. Columns starting with `one\_hot' are results from the one-hot, rather than the original, data set.

### cleaned_data.csv
Data associated with this study that has been cleaned, filtered and transformed, ready for analysis. Raw data can found in the PROTEUS database.
